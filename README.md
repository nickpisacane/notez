# Notez

Are your notes backed by a git repo? Perhaps you write your notes in Markdown with a client like Obsidian or Notable? Then this is for you!

Notez is a daemon that can watch multiple "notebooks" (directories with a git repo)
and automatically sync with your favorite remote host by committing and pushing
whenever file changes are detected.

## TODO

- [ ] install script
- [ ] Handle config changes
